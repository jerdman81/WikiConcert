# WikiConcert
## By: Team Fire Nation

The WikiConcert App is a team project where we are building an ASP.NET Web App that enables users to keep track of live concerts.

The app consists of a database with tables for:
- Bands
- Venues
- Songs
- Concerts
- Setlists


In Version 1.0 (MVP), users will have the ability to:
- Search for Concert by name, band, venue, date, or genre 
- List performances of a song
- List appearances (bands) at a concert
- Add concerts, bands, venues, etc.
- Update concerts, bands, venues, etc.
- Remove concerts, bands, venues, etc.
- List concerts in chronological order

For Version 2.0, planned features include:
- Implementing a User Interface
- Mapping.  Implement feature to display Venues on Google Maps
- Track user concert attendance.  Users will be able to create an account and save Concerts 
- Implement user roles.  Admins will have full permissions while standard users



The main goal of this exercise is to gain practice using:
- Agile workflow
- Practice branching and pull requests in Git
- Practice building an app as a team
